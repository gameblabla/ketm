Kill Everything That Moves v0.0.9, by Walter Haslbeck.

KETM is an unfinished shmup that was only released as a demo for the Pandora Coding Competition in 2010.

It contains 4 levels and is fairly modeable too. 

However, since they were crap anyway and even less finished than the stock game, i've deleted them from my repo.

This port for the RS-97 (using sdlfix, not worth bothering scaling) and eventually other platforms such as the GCW0 and Nspire
has improved performance (removed scaler code and disabled conditions and 
some fixes because the original code had some strange leftover code that broke more than anything else...

And also, this game is not 64-bits clean yet. It runs but the enemies disappear before they are even out of the screen. 

I also plan on a port to SDL2 so it could eventually be released on the Google Play.

But the game came with no license, so he might get mad at me for doing so...
